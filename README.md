## Introduction

4Dev-Shop is a simulated shopping platform that uses cutting-edge frontend technologies to deliver a smooth and responsive user experience. The project showcases advanced use of React, Vite, and various optimization techniques.

## Technologies and Tools

- **Authentication & Security üîê**
  - JWT & OAuth: Implement user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Token) to manage login and registration, with httpOnly cookies for enhanced security. Support for login via OAuth (Google, Facebook).
- **Form Management & Validation üìù**
  - React Hook Form / Formik: Used for advanced form management, including validation, data submission, and error state handling.
  - Yup: Used for schema-based validation, ensuring data is correct before submission.
- **State Management üìä**
  - React Toolkit & Context API: Combining Redux Toolkit for global state management and Context API for local or less complex states. This combination allows efficient management of component interactions and data flow.
- **UI, Accessibility & Styling üé®**
  - Tailwind CSS with Dark Mode: Using Tailwind for creating a responsive, modern design with native dark mode support.
  - Emotion (CSS-in-JS): For integrating dynamic and isolated styling directly into React components.
  - Progress Indicator: To help users understand the status of the registration and checkout process, using a visual indicator.
  - Overlay Loader: Added a screen-covering loader during the payment process using Stripe.
- **Optimization & Performance ‚ö°**
  - Lazy Loading & Code Splitting: Using async loading and code splitting to enhance site performance, loading only what‚Äôs necessary.
  - React Profiler: Monitoring and optimizing component render times.
  - Manual Chunking: Manually splitting JavaScript files to optimize bundle loading.
  - Vite Plugin Bundle Analyzer: Used to analyze bundle sizes and optimize the code.
- **Data Handling & APIs üåê**
  - Axios: Used for API calls, with debounce and throttle techniques to optimize requests and prevent overloads.
  - LocalStorage: For caching product data, such as images or information, improving user experience.
  - JSON: Using JSON data to simulate products and images.
- **Payment & Checkout üí≥**
  - React Stripe.js: Integrating Stripe to simulate credit card payments, managing a secure and fast checkout flow.
  - Multi-step Checkout Form: Implementing a multi-step checkout process, improving clarity for users during purchase.
- **SEO & Accessibility üîç**
  - React Helmet: Used for managing dynamic metadata, such as page titles and descriptions, to improve SEO.
  - Accessibility & Semantic HTML: Ensuring that the user interface is fully accessible, using semantic HTML practices and auditing with Lighthouse.
- **AI Integration ü§ñ**
  - TensorFlow.js: Simulating AI Recommendations to suggest related products, demonstrating the ability to work with artificial intelligence technologies in the frontend.
- **Load Optimization üöÄ**
  - Prefetching & Preloading: Using prefetching techniques to pre-load future resources, improving navigation experience.
- **Hosting & Deployment üåê**
  - Netlify or Render: Using Netlify or Render for continuous deployment, ensuring that every update is immediately visible in production.
